#Complete List Cheet Sheet

#Making a List basically has square brackets
lis = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

#Printing all elements in the list
print(lis)

#Printing particular element of list - Indexing starts with 0 in python same alike other languages
print(lis[0])

#Python is having negative indexing so you can reverse elements by just using python inbuilt functions
print(lis[-1])

#The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).
print(lis[2:5])

#This will print items from beginning to the mentioned index (mentioned index postion will be excluded)
print(lis[:3])

#This will print items from the mentioned position to the end
print(lis[3:])

#Priting the items in list in reverse order
print(lis[::-1])

#Changing the item in list
lis[0] = "Djcodes"
print(lis)

list1 = ["Deep","Joshi",27,02.01] # A list can be made like !!! this list is mutable and items can be changed

list1.append("List Example") # To Append the item at the last index in list we can use append method

print(list1) # After Appending the list result

list2 = list1.copy() #Copy function is used to copy data from list to another one

print(list2) # Copied List Data

print(list1.count(27)) # It Returns how many times element is present in list

print(list1.index(02.01)) # Returns the index position of element passed in the function

list1.insert(4,"Djcodes") #For Inserting Element at given positon along with passing the value

print(list1) #Djcodes Inserted at 4th position
#Here looking onto append function as the value we added with append function was pushed by 1 index position

list1.pop(5) #Removes value of given index position

print(list1) #As a result 'List Example' was removed
#You can also use remove function to remove an element with its value
list1.remove("Djcodes")

print(list1) #Djcodes will be removed from output

To Reverse a List its very Easy in python (Note : You only have to use same data types for reverseing else 
it will generate an error)

print(["Dj"] * 3) # For Printing list Multiple times
